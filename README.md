# Predicting a player's NFL Draft position

This project is my first Capstone project in the Springboard Data Science Career Track course. The primary dataset for 
this analysis is NFL Combine (Combine) data. The Combine is an invitation-only showcase for aspiring NFL players. They
perform various physical and mental drills and tasks. The Combine is a part of the total evaluation process by NFL teams 
prior to the seven-round NFL Draft. This project will use these Combine results to predict which round a player might be 
selected in the NFL Draft.

This repo contains the code, data, documentation and reports for this ongoing project.
